In this episode, I was joined by [Jeffrey Palermo](https://jeffreypalermo.com/) to chat about AI-driven development and DevOps. We discussed how AI is changing the way we write software, and the importance of having mature DevOps processes in place (eg. good tests, CI pipelines, and specs) before we can properly start leveraging AI to write features in a reliable and consistent way.

Jeffrey Palermo is the host of the [Azure &amp; DevOps podcast](https://azuredevopspodcast.clear-measure.com/), Founder and Chief Architect of [Clear Measure](https://clearmeasure.com/), a long-time Microsoft MVP, tech speaker, book author, and more!
