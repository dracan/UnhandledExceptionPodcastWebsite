In this episode, I was joined by [Alex Frankel](https://twitter.com/adotfrank) to chat about [Azure Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep)! Bicep is a new DSL that transpiles down to native ARM templates. Except that it _greatly_ improved upon the very hard to read and write ARM templates, making _Infrastructure as Code_ in Azure a far nicer user experience. We delved into the Bicep language, the tooling, a bit of the history - and even geeked out a bit on how awesome .NET has become!
