In this episode, I was joined by [Gui Ferreira](https://guiferreira.me/) to chat about one of my favourite topics - life productivity! Where we talked about goal-setting, time management, and productivity in general. We also chatted a bit at the end about testing and AI.

Guilherme Ferreira, also known as Gui, is a Minimalist Software Craftsman, passionate about simplicity and continuous learning. Gui is a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies, a Tech Speaker, a YouTuber, and a .NET content creator. With over 15 years of experience in software development, Gui went from Startups to Tech Giants. Along his journey, he got to know several hats, including Software Engineer, Architect, CTO, and Developer Advocate, gathering a diverse and invaluable skill set.
