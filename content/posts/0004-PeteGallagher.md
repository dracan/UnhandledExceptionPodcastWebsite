In this episode, I was joined by [Pete Gallagher](https://twitter.com/pete_codes) - Microsoft MVP, Pluralsight author, speaker, user-group organiser, and huge fan of IoT devices and STEM. We had great fun chatted for over an hour about various topics - mostly themed around technologies helping kids get into coding - but with many tangents thrown into the mix!
