In this episode, I was joined by Jérôme Laban, the CTO of the Uno Platform. We chatted about the Uno Platform itself, which is a cross-platform framework for building single-codebase applications that run on Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and the web via WebAssembly. We also discussed a new Hot Design feature, which is a designer/builder that during development, becomes part your application at runtime, so you can live build/edit your UIs with an easy drag and drop interface, whilst your application is running! Given you're building your UI at runtime, the designer UI also has access to your _real_ data and its properties for databinding, and renders them as you edit!

Jérôme Laban is the Chief Technology Officer at [Uno Platform](https://platform.uno/). With over two decades of experience in software development, Jérôme is a recognized expert in cross-platform development, .NET technologies, and has been awarded Microsoft MVP award for many years.
At Uno Platform, Jerome leads the technical vision and development of the framework, empowering developers worldwide to create rich, performant applications across all platforms. A passionate advocate for open-source and community-driven development, Jerome frequently shares his insights at global conferences, webinars, and on Twitch.
