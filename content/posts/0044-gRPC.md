In this episode, I was joined by [Poornima Nayar](https://twitter.com/PoornimaNayar) to chat all about gRPC! gRPC is Google's implementation of RPC. Since .NET Core 3.0, gRPC has first-class support in .NET and seems to be the way forward for remote procedure calls. We chatted about what gRPC is, how to use it, what usecases you'd want to use it for, and much much more!

Poornima is a .NET developer with over 10 years of experience in .NET and Umbraco. She is passionate about learning new technologies and keeping herself up-to-date with the latest developments in technology. Outside her work, Poornima enjoys music and is undergoing training in Indian Classical music. Based in Langley, UK she mothers a little girl and spends her spare time reading, cooking, and watching movies.
