In this episode, I was joined by Joe Albahari, author of one of my favourite software development tools - LINQPad! This is a tool that I use on a daily basis, and it saves me so much time! So I especially enjoyed chatting with Joe about the _many_ features of LINQPad, his experiences when developing it, and also future plans.
