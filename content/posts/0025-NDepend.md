In this episode, I was joined by [Patrick Smacchia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-smacchia-b0123110/), all the way from the beautiful island of Mauritius, to chat all about [NDepend](https://www.ndepend.com/)! An amazing tool for analysing .NET projects and displaying tons of useful information to help improve code quality. From scanning for code quality issues, to showing plenty of dependency graphs and code visualisations.
