In this episode, I was joined for a second time by [Shahid Iqbal](https://twitter.com/ShahidDev), this time to chat about Platform Engineering and Infrastructure as Code! We discussed what Platform Engineering means, and also different IaC tools. And Shahid's undying love for Pulumi! ðŸ˜‚

Shahid is a Principal Platform Architect at [Auror](https://www.auror.co/) based in Auckland NZ, and is also an Azure MVP.
