In this group episode, I was joined by Carl Sargunar, Lotte Pitcher, Carole Rennie Logan, and Callum Whyte, to discuss the Umbraco community and CMS! We chatted about the amazing community around Umbraco, as well as the features of the CMS itself. It definitely made me want to reach for Umbraco next time I need a CMS!
