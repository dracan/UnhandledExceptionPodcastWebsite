In this episode, I was joined by [Debbie O'Brien](https://debbie.codes/) to chat about [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) - Microsoft's open-source end-to-end testing framework. I'm a huge fan of Playwright, so I was really excited to have this chat with Debbie. We covered a lot of ground, including features such as Codegen, Trace Viewer, and UI Mode. We also spoke a lot about AI - including the exciting [Playwright MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) which enables AI agents to automate browser interactions!

Debbie has been an integral part of Playwright as a Principal Program Manager at Microsoft and has led the Playwright community, shaping much of what Playwright has become today - driving a lot of the features mentioned above. She's also a Google Developer Expert in web technologies, Nuxt Ambassador, and is a former Microsoft Most Valuable Professional in developer technologies, Media Developer Expert and GitHub star alumni.
