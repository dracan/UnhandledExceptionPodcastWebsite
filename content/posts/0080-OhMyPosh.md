In this episode, I was delighted to be joined by [Jan De Dobbeleer](https://ohmyposh.dev/) to chat about the amazing [Oh My Posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/)! This is something I've used for years, so it was really great chatting with Jan about it. Oh My Posh is a highly customisable cross-platform prompt engine for any shell. We also chatted about his experiences as an open-source developer.

Jan is a passionate software engineer with a love for creating clean, intuitive, and user-friendly tools. With a background in computer science and years of experience in the industry, he has a deep understanding of what it takes to build successful and widely-used open-source projects.

In addition to oh-my-posh, Jan is also an active contributor to other open-source projects and a frequent speaker at tech conferences and meetups. He is always looking for new ways to improve and expand upon his work, and is constantly pushing the boundaries of what is possible with terminal customization.
