This episode was a solo episode where I try my best to _"demystify"_ Docker! A difficult task over an audio podcast, so hopefully it's !digestible! I cover the following topics...

* What are containers and images?
* Container registries
* Use cases for containers
* Interacting with Docker
* Docker Compose
* Volumes
* Building your own images
* Image layer caching
* Multi-stage Dockerfiles
* About Container Orchestrators
* Using Docker for local development
