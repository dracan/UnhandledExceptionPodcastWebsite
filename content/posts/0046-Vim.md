In this episode, I was joined again by [Joseph Woodward](https://twitter.com/_josephwoodward) to geek out on Vim! Joe joined us on the [last episode](/posts/0045-go/) to talk about the Go programming language - and as we're both huge fans of Vim, we decided to stay on and record a second episode chatting about it!

In it, we talk about both the Vim way of using the keyboard (Vim keybindings), and also Vim the editor and its plugin ecosystem.

Joseph is a Software Engineer at [Form3](https://www.form3.tech/), speaker, and open-source contributor. Lover of Go, OSS, Neovim and distributed systems things.
