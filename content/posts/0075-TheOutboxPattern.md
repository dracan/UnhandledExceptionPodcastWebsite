In this episode, I was joined by Tomek Masternak and Szymon Pobiega from Particular Software (NServiceBus) for a technical discussion about the Outbox Pattern! The pattern is designed to
improve reliability of messaging by storing outgoing messages in a database table (the "outbox") as part of the same transaction that modifies business data - allowing a separate process to read and publish those messages to a message broker.
