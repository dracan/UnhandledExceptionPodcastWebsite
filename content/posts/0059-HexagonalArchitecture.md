In this episode, I was joined by [Valentina Cupać](https://twitter.com/ValentinaCupac) to chat about Hexagonal Architecture. We discussed what Hexagonal Architecture is, how it can help us build better software, and the difference between it and other similar architectures, such as Clean and Onion Architecture.

Valentina is a Technical Coach at Optive, helping development teams deliver quality software with TDD and Clean Architecture. She also the runs the [Tech Excellence community](https://www.meetup.com/techexcellence/).
