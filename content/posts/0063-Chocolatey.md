In this episode, I was joined by [Gary Ewan Park](https://twitter.com/gep13) to chat about [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/), and what it's been like as a developer working on it. Chocolatey is a package manager for Windows, and it's a tool that I've used for many years - so really enjoyed chatting with Gary about it!

Gary is a Principal Software Engineer at Chocolatey Software and Microsoft Visual Studio and Development Technologies MVP and GitHub Star.
