In this episode, I was joined for the second time by Nick Chapsas! This time, we chatted about his new [Dometrain](https://www.dometrain.com/) teaching platform. Nick started off creating courses on his own website, nickchapsas.com, which he's recently rebranded to Dometrain and reached out to other authors to also create courses - myself included! I've recently released a Docker course on Dometrain, and we chatted about my experience doing this, as well as Nick's story and motivations behind building Dometrain.
