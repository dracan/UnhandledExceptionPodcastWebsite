In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by [Kayla Cinnamon](https://twitter.com/cinnamon_msft) to chat about the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)! I'm a huge fan of WT, and use it daily - so it was an honour to have Kayla on to chat about it! Kayla is a Program Manager at Microsoft, Delivering Windows Terminal and Cascadia Code. She's also the Host of Windows Wednesday, and works on the Windows developer experience.
