In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by [Nick Chapsas](https://twitter.com/nickchapsas)! If you're a .NET developer - then his [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/Elfocrash) is an absolute must! Given all the amazing topics he covers on his channel - it would have been a shame to just chat with him about a single topic! So we decided to do a few lightning topics instead! Here's what we geeked out on...

* .NET 6 Minimal API
* The outdated opinion of some non .NET developers on C# and .NET
* GitHub Copilot
* MediatR
* Open Source
