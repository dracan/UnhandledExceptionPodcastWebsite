In this episode, I was joined by [Callum Linington](https://twitter.com/No1Melman) to chat about Event Sourcing! Events over time are how the world works - so shouldn't we be leveraging that in our architectures? As quite often happens, we also went on one or two tangents, and covered a ton of other related including MediatR, CQRS, F#, DDD, Rx, Redux, and more!
