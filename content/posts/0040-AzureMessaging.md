In this episode, I was joined by [Sean Feldman](https://twitter.com/sfeldman) to chat all about messaging in Azure! Starting off explaining why you'd want to use messaging in your solutions. Then explaining the difference between different types of messaging - eg. pub/sub, event streaming, etc. Then going through discussing all the different Azure services that relate to messaging.

Sean Feldman is a consulting Solutions Architect and an Azure MVP. He likes tinkering with various Azure-related services and is in seventh heaven when cloud and distributed technologies are combined. When he's away from his computer and back on planet earth, he's having fun with family and his Malamute.
