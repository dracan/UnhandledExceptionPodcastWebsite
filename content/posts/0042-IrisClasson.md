In this episode, I was joined by [Iris Classon](https://twitter.com/irisclasson) to chat all about her book - [The Unlikely Success of a Copy Paste Developer](https://thecopypastedeveloper.com/). The book is a very fun, light-hearted, fictional novel about a software developer called Leo, and a range of very _interesting_ characters Leo has to work with. I've recently read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As a software developer, a lot of the stories are very relatable!

Iris Classon is an appreciated speaker, writer, blogger, Microsoft C# MVP and member of MEET (Microsoft Extended Experts Team) with a tremendous passion for programming. She has had a remarkable career path that proves that nothing is impossible - switching from being a licensed and registered clinical dietician to a software developer with a dozen certifications and a full time developer job with renowned companies.
