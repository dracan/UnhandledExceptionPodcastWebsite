In this episode, I was joined by [Jessica Engström](https://twitter.com/EngstromJess) to chat about UX! A topic that most developers (myself included) need to be more aware of when building UIs! Jessica is also a fellow podcast host, co-hosting the awesome [Coding After Work](http://codingafterwork.com/) podcast!
