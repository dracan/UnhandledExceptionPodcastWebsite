In this episode, I was joined by [Clifford Agius](https://twitter.com/CliffordAgius) to chat about both .NET MAUI, and also developing for IoT. (These were separate topics - not specifically IoT on MAUI). Clifford is an airline pilot who's also a freelance .NET developer who regularly blogs and speaks at conferences around the world!

MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a new .NET framework for building multi-platform apps - both mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (macOS/Windows) using C# and XAML in a single codebase. It also supports Blazor components for those that prefer that over XAML.

We also chatted about an incredible life-changing project that Clifford has worked on, building a 3D-printed prosthetic arm, which has helped turn a young boy's life around.
