For this very first episode of 2021, I was joined by [Simon Painter](https://www.twitter.com/madSimonJ) to talk all about Functional Programming in C#! We spoke about functional concepts, plus terms such as _Options_, _Maybes_, and even tried to explain what a Monad is! As usual, there were a few tangents, and we also touched on topics such as React, TDD, and much more!
