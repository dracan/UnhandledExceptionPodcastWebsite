As developers, we're always looking for ways to improve and optimise our code. Yet we often neglect our body's hardware and software. In this episode, I was joined by Rob West, to chat about how we can use mindfulness, nutrition, and exercise to upgrade our brain's operating system. A large part of our discussion was about our ability to focus, why are brains naturally struggle with this, especially in the modern world - and techniques to help us with this. We did, of course, also chat about coffee! ☕️
