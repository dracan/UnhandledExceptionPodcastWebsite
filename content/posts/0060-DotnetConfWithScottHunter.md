In this episode I was honoured to be joined by [Scott Hunter](https://twitter.com/coolcsh) to chat about the announcements from .NET Conf 2023! The main areas we discussed were C#12 features, the new .NET Aspire, C# Devkit, Native AOT, and also touched a bit on Blazor. As always - it's an exciting time to be a .NET developer!
