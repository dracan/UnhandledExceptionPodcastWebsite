In this episode, I was joined by [Paul Michaels](https://twitter.com/paul_michaels) and [Kev Smith](https://twitter.com/kev_bite), to chat about their monthly online meetup they both run.

MiniHack is an online tech-agnostic monthly meetup, where teams of between 3 and 6 people compete to produce the best solution to a given problem. In their own words - _"Where we meet monthly to come up with cool solutions to pointless problems"_.
