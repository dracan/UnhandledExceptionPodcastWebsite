In this episode, I was joined by [James World](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-world-08a55a1/) to chat about AI for developers. We covered a lot of general AI chat - from using it to quickly knock up tools, to spec-driven development, and much more. We also discussed the [Microsoft Agent Framework](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-framework) - a new open-source framework for building AI agents and multi-agent workflows.

James World is a seasoned technology leader and Solution Architect with over three decades of experience building and guiding software solutions across the financial and enterprise sectors. He's a passionate polyglot programmer, with deep expertise in C# and the Azure ecosystem, including years spent learning and teaching at Microsoft where he was a consultant advising customers building solutions on the Microsoft stack. Outside of hands-on engineering and architecture, he loves exploring continuous learning, mentorship, and ways to help teams level up their craft - topics he's shared on The Unhandled Exception Podcast and in tech communities around .NET and cloud computing.
