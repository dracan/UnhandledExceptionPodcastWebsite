In this episode, I was joined by [Stuart Leeks](https://twitter.com/stuartleeks) to chat all about WSL2, and his new book, [WSL 2 Tips, Tricks, and Techniques](https://wsl.tips/book)! We also covered plenty of other topics, such as public speaking, Windows Terminal, standing desks, and much more! Stuart is a Principal Software Development Engineer at Microsoft.
