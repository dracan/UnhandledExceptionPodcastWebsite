`throw new UnhandledExceptionPodcast("Episode 72: Exceptions - With Callum Linington");`

In this episode, I was joined for a second time by Callum Linington - this time to discuss exceptions, which is quite fitting given the show's name! We chatted about why you should avoid using exceptions for your main business logic and control flow, and explored better ways to handle errors. And I'm afraid the "monad" word got thrown in too! ðŸ™ˆ

Callum is a dedicated leader of engineering teams, passionate about guiding ambitious engineers and fostering creativity. He leads by example, helping team members grow while aligning their work with business goals through Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. Known as a code connoisseur, Callum is passionate about Test-Driven Development (TDD). A strong advocate for F# and functional programming, he values simplicity and expressiveness in code, continually advancing his skills through ongoing learning.
