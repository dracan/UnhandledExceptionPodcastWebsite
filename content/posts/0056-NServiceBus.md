In this episode, I had great fun chatting with [Laïla Bougriâ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lailabougria/) about NServiceBus and how it can help with your distributed architecture. From its support for observability (including OTel) and dashboarding, to sagas and pub/sub. Even zombie and ghost messages! (spooky!). And as has been known to happen on this show - we did end up going on a tangent and geeking out about the awesome Jetbrains Rider too!

Laïla is a Solutions Architect and Software Engineer at Particular Software. She's also a Microsoft MVP, and frequent speaker talking about topics such as dotnet, messaging, distributed systems, and software engineering in general.
