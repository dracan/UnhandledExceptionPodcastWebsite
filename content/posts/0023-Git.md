In this episode, I was joined by [Jesse Liberty](https://twitter.com/JesseLiberty) and [James World](https://twitter.com/jamesw0rld) to chat about a topic I'm also personally very passionate about - the Git source control system.

Jesse is a fellow podcast host, as well as an author of a book about Git.

James is a Solution Architect who has done many a talk on Git and likes to delve a bit deeper into what goes on under the hood (as you'll see in this episode!).
