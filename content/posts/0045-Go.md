In this episode, I was joined by [Joseph Woodward](https://twitter.com/_josephwoodward) to chat all about the Go programming language. Joe has done a lot of dotnet in the past, but is now focusing more on Go - so an ideal guest to help us compare on contrast.

Joseph is a Software Engineer at [Form3](https://www.form3.tech/), speaker, and open-source contributor. Lover of Go, OSS, Neovim and distributed systems things.
