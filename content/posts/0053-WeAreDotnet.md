In this episode, I was joined by both [Tim Cadenbach](https://twitter.com/TimCadenbach) and [Matthias Jost](https://twitter.com/jost0101) to chat about the exciting new .NET community - [We Are .NET](https://www.wearedotnet.io/)! At its core, it's a community portal aggregating and presenting videos, blogs, twitch, and other feeds of any creator with .NET content. However, it's not just content aggregation though - and is becoming a rapidly growing community.
