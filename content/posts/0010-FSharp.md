In this group episode I was joined by [Scott Wlaschin](https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin), [Isaac Abraham](https://twitter.com/isaac_abraham), and [Ian Russell](https://twitter.com/ijrussell) - to talk all about F#! This is .NET's functional programming language, and we discussed functional programming, and the benefits of using a functional programming language like F#, whilst also comparing it to other languages like C#.
