In this episode, I was joined by Scott Sauber to chat about GitHub Actions. Before that though, we chatted about the differences between 'Continuous Integration', 'Continuous Delivery', and 'Continuous Deployment'. Then we delved into the world of GitHub Actions, and how they can be used to automate your workflows.

Scott is a software consultant and primarily does web development using ASP.NET Core and JavaScript. His second passion behind web development is helping teams realize their potential through technical practices (such as CI/CD, IAC, TDD, etc.) and working more effectively (such as limiting WIP, visualizing work, etc). He's a Microsoft MVP, Redgate Community Ambassador, international speaker, and co-organizes the Iowa .NET User Group.
