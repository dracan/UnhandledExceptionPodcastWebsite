In this episode, I was joined by good friend and ex-colleague, [Dushyant Priyadarshee](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dpriyadarshee/) to chat about devops! We covered a lot of ground, from what devops is, to infrastructure as code deployments, to exams and certifications! Dushyant is a Senior Platform Engineer at [NewDay](https://www.newday.co.uk/).
