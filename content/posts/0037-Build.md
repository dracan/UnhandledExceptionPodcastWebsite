Microsoft have just had their annual Build conference - which comes with a whole host of exciting announcements and discussions about hot programming topics in the Microsoft developer space. And each year, I long for a podcast episode to come out straight after Build, overviewing them! Well, this year - this podcast aims to do just that! In this episode, I was joined by both [Scott Hunter](https://twitter.com/coolcsh) and [Gaurav Seth](https://twitter.com/gauravseth) to chat about various topics. Check out the links below for a guide to what we discussed.
