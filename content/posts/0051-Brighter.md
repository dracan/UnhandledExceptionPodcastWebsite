In this episode, I was joined by [Ian Cooper](https://hachyderm.io/@ICooper) to chat about the [Brighter](https://github.com/BrighterCommand/Brighter) and [Darker](https://github.com/BrighterCommand/Darker) frameworks.

Brighter is a framework for building messaging applications with .NET and C#. It can be used with an in-memory bus, or for interoperability in a microservices architecture allowing out of process messaging via a wider range of middleware transports. And Darker is the _query_ counterpart to Brighter.

Ian is a Senior Principal Engineer at Just Eat Takeaway, frequent public speaker, and organiser of [London .NET](https://www.meetup.com/london-net-user-group/) user group.
