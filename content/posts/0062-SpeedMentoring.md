In this episode, I was joined by [Mia Gordon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mia-gordon-63940273/) to chat about speed mentoring! I was recently invited to a speed mentoring event that she organised, and it was such a fun event and great idea and concept - that I invited her onto the show to chat about it! We also spoke about the power of community, and how big a difference it can make to your career and life.

Mia is a Full Stack Developer at Ministry of Justice Digital and Technology. She's an ex event-manager, who then switched careers to software development. So she has tons of experience in organising events like these speed mentoring sessions!
