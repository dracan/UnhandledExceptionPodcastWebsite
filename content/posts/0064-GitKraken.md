In this episode, I was joined by [Justin Roberts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/justinar/) and [Eric Amodio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamodio/) to chat about the [GitKraken](https://chocolatey.org/) Git client. We chatted about its features, and also what it's been like working on it. We also spoke about the GitLens VS Code client.

Justin is the Senior Director of Product at GitKraken, and has been leading the design of the GitKraken Git Client. Eric is the CTO, and also the creator of GitLens for VS Code, and previously a VS Code developer at Microsoft.
