In this episode, I was honoured to be joined by [Andrew Lock](https://andrewlock.net/), who is probably best known for his amazing 'must-subscribe' blog - [andrewlock.net](https://andrewlock.net/). He's also the author of the Manning ebook, [ASP.NET Core in Action, Second Edition](https://www.manning.com/books/asp-net-core-in-action-second-edition). We covered a lot in this episode - from the different flavours of ASP.NET, to Kubernetes, Blazor, gRPC, testing, Minimal API, MediatR... and more!
