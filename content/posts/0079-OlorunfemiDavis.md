In this episode, I was joined by [Olorunfemi Davis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olorunfemidavis/) to chat about AI. We chatted about Microsoft Copilot Studio, Semantic Kernel, and AI in general.

With 9 years of experience, Olorunfemi specialises in architecting, building, and optimising secure, high-performance systems. His expertise covers the full spectrum of C# / .NET development and managing infrastructure across Microsoft Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud (GCP). He focuses on bridging Dev and Ops to drive efficiency, CI/CD Automation, and data-driven reliability, incorporating robust security features like end-to-end encryption and leveraging techniques like AI/machine learning to streamline complex workflows.
