In this episode, I was honoured to be joined by [Maddy Montaquila](https://bsky.app/profile/maddymontaquila.net) to chat about the amazing .NET Aspire! We covered a lot of stuff in this episode - from what Aspire is, and its features - to various stories about the decisions made and the future plans for Aspire. We also took a few tangents, chatting about AI and vibe coding! It was such a fun conversation!

We also talk about my new Dometrain course on .NET Aspire, which [can be found here](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-dotnet-aspire/?ref=dan-clarke&promotion=podcast).

Maddy Montaquila is a Senior Program Manager for .NET Aspire at Microsoft. And also (I've only just discovered!) - sings in [a band](https://bigrav.band)! ü§Ø
