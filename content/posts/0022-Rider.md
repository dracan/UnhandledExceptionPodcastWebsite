Everyone who knows me, knows I'm a _massive_ fan of [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/)! So it was about time we had an episode on it! In this episode, I was joined by both [Maarten Balliauw](https://twitter.com/maartenballiauw) and [Kirill Skrygan](https://twitter.com/kskrygan) to chat all about it. We discussed the Rider architecture, Code With Me, Remote Development; and also the awesome power of keyboard shortcuts!
