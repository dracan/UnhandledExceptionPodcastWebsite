In this episode, I was joined by [Tanya Janca](https://twitter.com/shehackspurple) to chat about Application Security (or AppSec for short!). We chatted about various topics - from security topics and training, to her book and online community, to public speaking!

Tanya is the founder and CEO at [We Hack Purple](https://community.wehackpurple.com/), which is an online learning academy, community and weekly podcast that revolves around teaching everyone to create secure software. She's also the Director of Developer Relations at [Bright](https://brightsec.com/), and best-selling author of the book [Alice and Bob Learn Application Security](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Alice-Bob-Learn-Application-Security/dp/1119687357).
