In this milestone 50th episode (🥳🎉🍻) - I was joined by [David Wengier](https://aus.social/@davidwengier) to chat about how .NET's hot reload works! We covered how the metadata in dotnet assemblies work, and how hot reload manipulates this data in various ways in memory to do its thing. We also touched a bit on the whole hot-reload dotnet drama thing! 🤫🙈

We had quite a fun chat afterwards too, so decided to include that in the episode - so keep playing past my usual outro to hear that.

[David](https://aus.social/@davidwengier) is a Roslyn and Razor tooling developer at Microsoft, living in Melbourne, Australia.
