In this episode, I was honoured to be joined by [Mads Torgersen](https://twitter.com/MadsTorgersen), [Dan Roth](https://twitter.com/danroth27), and [Scott Hunter](https://twitter.com/coolcsh)!!! ü§Ø We chatted about Blazor in .NET 8; C#12 interceptors, C#13, C#36 (you have to listen üòâ), source generators, discriminated unions, AOT, and Stephen Toub's performance blog posts!

[Mads](https://twitter.com/MadsTorgersen) is the Lead Designer of C#, [Dan](https://twitter.com/danroth27) is Product Manager on the ASP.NET Team for Blazor, and [Scott](https://twitter.com/coolcsh) is the VP of Product, working on the Azure Dev Experience team.
