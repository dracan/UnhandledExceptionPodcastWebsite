Ever wondered what's involved when being a guest on a podcast? Below are a few key points that I tend to mention to each guest. I thought I'd consolidate them here for quick reference...

# The podcast is _not_ live!

I do _a lot_ of editing afterwards, and it's easy to chop bits out whilst editing. If you need to pause and think about how you're going to answer a question - that's fine - I chop that pause out. If you need to stop and Google something because you can't remember the name - that's fine too, I chop that out. If you need to cough, sneeze, have a drink, or go to the loo - that's also fine. Also, if you say something that you then want to rephrase, or say more clearly - just say so, pause, and try again. I can cut out the first attempt.

The finished podcast will always be _much_ more seamless than during recording. Knowing this up-front, should hopefully make it a much more relaxing and less stressful experience.

# How do we record?

I use a platform called [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/) for recording the audio. Zencastr is just a webapp, and there's nothing to install. It has video too so that we can see each other, but only the audio will be recorded. Zencastr automatically records high-quality wav files _locally_ for each person, and uploads it in the background. I can then download those wav files later for editing. I get a wav file per person, so I can edit each person's audio as a separate audio channel - which makes a _huge_ difference to my ability to edit. It might be worth joining the Zencastr link beforehand to ensure that your system passes all its health-checks.

# What planning is involved before hand?

I normally create a shared Google Doc and share with the guest(s). This is basically a brain-dump, where both myself and guest(s) can dump ideas into it. This'll form a rough structure to the show. But given the shows are very _conversational_, we don't need to stick with that structure, and we can go _off-piste_. The doc is just a rough guide.

# Headphones (IMPORTANT)

Please make sure you use headphones or earphones instead of a PC/laptop speaker. A speaker might work with Zoom or Teams - but because Zencaster is recording unfiltered audio, there will be far too much echo where your microphone is also picking up your speakers.

# Do I need a super-duper microphone?

A microphone that isn't your built-in laptop microphone is definitely preferred. This doesn't have to be a super-duper few-hundred-pound microphone though! If you have a headset with a directional mic - that'll be much better than a built-in laptop mic. Whatever your setup - it's worth doing a few test recordings using a tool like [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and listen back through headphones. When listening back, ask yourself if you'd be happy with the quality if you were a podcast listener.

When it comes down to it - if you're concerned about your audio quality - just ask me, and we can discuss different ideas together beforehand to get the most of of your setup. And we can also do a test recording beforehand if you're still unsure.

# Background noise (IMPORTANT)

Please do aim to limit background noise. I can cut out background noise during editing if it happens when myself or another guest is speaking - but I can't cut out noises in the background when you're talking (as it'll be part of the same wav recording). This includes fans, squeaky chairs, people in other rooms, you accidentally banging the desk whilst talking, etc.

# Anything else I need to know?

* I normally do "dev-tips" at the end - where both myself and the guest does a dev-tip. This is completely optional - but if you're happy doing one, then time to get your thinking cap on! :) Basically, a short tip - anything you like - doesn't just have to be dev-related - for example, I've done productivity tips on past shows.
* Have fun! :)
