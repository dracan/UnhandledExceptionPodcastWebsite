The podcast is open to sponsorship opportunities. If you're interested in sponsoring the podcast, please get in touch with me to discuss. I can be reached any of the social links mentioned on the sidebar (a Discord DM is preferred), or by a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danclarkeuk/).

# Sponsorship Options

There are three places during the podcast to choose from...

* Near the start (pre-roll) which would be a max length of 30 seconds.
* During the middle (mid-roll) would be a max of 60 seconds.
* At the very end of the episode (post-roll), which would be a maximum of 20 seconds.

If you choose either pre or mid roll - I'll throw in a newsletter mention as part of it.

Pricing details will be provided upon request.
