      <p>Ever wondered what&rsquo;s involved when being a guest on a podcast? Below are a few key points that I tend to mention to each guest. I thought I&rsquo;d consolidate them here for quick reference&hellip;</p>
<h1 id="the-podcast-is-_not_-live">The podcast is <em>not</em> live!</h1>
<p>I do <em>a lot</em> of editing afterwards, and it&rsquo;s easy to chop bits out whilst editing. If you need to pause and think about how you&rsquo;re going to answer a question - that&rsquo;s fine - I chop that pause out. If you need to stop and Google something because you can&rsquo;t remember the name - that&rsquo;s fine too, I chop that out. If you need to cough, sneeze, have a drink, or go to the loo - that&rsquo;s also fine. Also, if you say something that you then want to rephrase, or say more clearly - just say so, pause, and try again. I can cut out the first attempt.</p>
<p>The finished podcast will always be <em>much</em> more seamless than during recording. Knowing this up-front, should hopefully make it a much more relaxing and less stressful experience.</p>
<h1 id="how-do-we-record">How do we record?</h1>
<p>I normally use a combination of a <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> call for video (which isn&rsquo;t recorded, it&rsquo;s just so we can see each other), and a platform called <a href="https://zencastr.com/">Zencastr</a> for recording the audio. I&rsquo;ll send you a Zoom invite beforehand, and will send you a Zencastr URL within the Zoom chat at the time. Zencastr is just a webapp, and there&rsquo;s nothing to install. It&rsquo;ll automatically record high-quality wav files <em>locally</em> for each person, and upload it in the background. I can then download those wav files later for editing. I get a wav file per person, so I can edit each person&rsquo;s audio as a separate audio channel - which makes a <em>huge</em> difference to my ability to edit.</p>
<h1 id="what-planning-is-involved-before-hand">What planning is involved before hand?</h1>
<p>I normally create a shared Google Doc and share with the guest(s). This is basically a brain-dump, where both myself and guest(s) can dump ideas into it. This&rsquo;ll form a rough structure to the show. But given the shows are very <em>conversational</em>, we don&rsquo;t need to stick with that structure, and we can go <em>off-piste</em>. The doc is just a rough guide.</p>
<h1 id="do-i-need-a-super-duper-microphone">Do I need a super-duper microphone?</h1>
<p>A microphone that isn&rsquo;t your built-in laptop microphone is definitely preferred. This doesn&rsquo;t have to be a super-duper few-hundred-pound microphone though! If you have a headset with a directional mic - that&rsquo;ll be much better than a built-in laptop mic. Or even those Apple earbuds with built-in mic are surprisingly good quality.</p>
<p>Also aim to limit background noise. I can cut this out when myself or another guest is talking - but I can&rsquo;t cut out noises in the background when you&rsquo;re talking (as it&rsquo;ll be part of the same wav recording). Perhaps do a few test recordings beforehand using a tool like <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> and listen back through headphones. Also listen out for echo from your voice bouncing off the walls.</p>
<p>When it comes down to it - if you&rsquo;re concerned about your audio quality - just ask me, and we can discuss different ideas together beforehand to get the most of of your setup. And we can also do a test recording beforehand if you&rsquo;re still unsure.</p>
<h1 id="anything-else-i-need-to-know">Anything else I need to know?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Please try to use headphones or earphones instead of a speaker - this limits your microphone also picking up your speakers.</li>
<li>I normally do &ldquo;dev-tips&rdquo; at the end - where both myself and the guest does a dev-tip. This is completely optional - but if you&rsquo;re happy doing one, then time to get your thinking cap on! :) Basically, a short tip - anything you like - doesn&rsquo;t just have to be dev-related - for example, I&rsquo;ve done productivity tips on past shows.</li>
<li>Have fun!</li>
