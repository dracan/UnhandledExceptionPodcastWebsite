      <description>In this last episode of the year, I was joined by Christos Matskas to talk all about Identity! Christos is the Program Manager for the Microsoft Identity Platform, so obviously the conversation was slightly biased towards AzureAD and B2C as an identity provider - but we also tried to cover some common identity topics, and demystify terminology such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, scopes, claims, and more! We even went a bit off-piste at the end and chatted about public speaking, languages (not programming languages), and even touched on speed reading!</description>
