We chatted about the Uno Platform itself, which is a cross-platform framework for building single-codebase applications that run on Windows, iOS, Android, macOS, Linux, and the web via WebAssembly. We also discussed a new Hot Design feature, which is a designer/builder that during development, becomes part your application at runtime, so you can live build/edit your UIs with an easy drag and drop interface, whilst your application is running! Given you&amp;rsquo;re building your UI at runtime, the designer UI also has access to your &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; data and its properties for databinding, and renders them as you edit!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

And I&amp;rsquo;m afraid the &amp;ldquo;monad&amp;rdquo; word got thrown in too! 🙈&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This approach promotes a clear separation of concerns, improves readability, and can lead to more maintainable and scalable codebases.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, it&amp;rsquo;s not just content aggregation though - and is becoming a rapidly growing community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-12742936&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/12742936-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-12742936&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;tim-cadenbach&#34;&gt;Tim Cadenbach&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/images/0053-WeAreDotnet/Tim.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tim is a developer evangelist at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepl.com/&#34;&gt;Deepl&lt;/a&gt; and Microsoft MVP.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this milestone 50th episode (🥳🎉🍻) - I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://aus.social/@davidwengier&#34;&gt;David Wengier&lt;/a&gt; to chat about how .NET&amp;rsquo;s hot reload works! We covered how the metadata in dotnet assemblies work, and how hot reload manipulates this data in various ways in memory to do its thing. We also touched a bit on the whole hot-reload dotnet drama thing! 🤫🙈&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We had quite a fun chat afterwards too, so decided to include that in the episode - so keep playing past my usual outro to hear that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Episode 49: Cake 🍰 - with Mattias Karlsson</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0049-cake/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0049-cake/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by Mattias Karlsson to chat about Cake! Nope, not the food - something &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt;! Cake is a build orchestration tool where your builds scripts are written in C#. There are tons of addons for most tasks you can think of, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write your own. And you can run these all locally just like you would on the build agent. I dread to think how many many days I&amp;rsquo;ve lost when doing CI/CD natively in YAML where I&amp;rsquo;ve had to push to CI/CD, waiting for a build agent to pick it up, just to find that I&amp;rsquo;d got a path or indentation wrong. Doing this locally in Cake dramatically reduces that developer cycle. And thanks to the VSCode extension adding intellisense and linting - this is reduced even further.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/isaacrlevin&#34;&gt;Isaac Levin&lt;/a&gt; that chat about&amp;hellip; way too many things to put in an episode title, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure! 😂 We decided to not have a particular topic in mind - and just chat and see where the conversation took us! We ended up talking about podcasting, working remotely and the pandemic, general career stuff, public speaking, containers, AWS, learning, mindsets, guitars, and more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isaac is a .NET Developer Advocate at Amazon Web Services and a Microsoft MVP. He hosts a podcast called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coffeeandopensource.com/&#34;&gt;Coffee and Open Source&lt;/a&gt;, where he interviews folks from across the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This episode was a solo episode where I try my best to &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;demystify&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; Docker! A difficult task over an audio podcast, so hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s digestible! I cover the following topics&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are containers and images?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Container registries&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Use cases for containers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Interacting with Docker&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Docker Compose&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Volumes&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Building your own images&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Image layer caching&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Multi-stage Dockerfiles&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;About Container Orchestrators&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Using Docker for local development&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-11339396&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/11339396-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-11339396&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;dans-social-links&#34;&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s social links&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dracan&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/danclarkeuk/&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/&#34;&gt;Docker docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.docker.com/compose/&#34;&gt;Docker Compose docs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kubernetes.io/&#34;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/multistage-dockerfiles&#34;&gt;Blog post: Switching to multi-stage Docker files&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VgStKMB1duY&amp;amp;feature=emb_imp_woyt&#34;&gt;Video: Integration Testing ASP.NET Core Web APIs with Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;devpick-links&#34;&gt;Devpick links&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-builtin-container-support-for-the-dotnet-sdk/&#34;&gt;Announcing built-in container support for the .NET SDK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

The book is a very fun, light-hearted, fictional novel about a software developer called Leo, and a range of very &lt;em&gt;interesting&lt;/em&gt; characters Leo has to work with. I&amp;rsquo;ve recently read the book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As a software developer, a lot of the stories are very relatable!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/MartinDotNet&#34;&gt;Martin Thwaites&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.honeycomb.io/&#34;&gt;Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; to chat about &lt;a href=&#34;https://opentelemetry.io/&#34;&gt;OpenTelemetry&lt;/a&gt;. OpenTelemetry (or OTel) standardises metrics, logs, and traces - allowing different systems and languages to be able to write telemetry data in a common format and be understood by any visualisation UIs that support it. This is becoming widely adopted, meaning that with minor changes to your applications - you can ship off telemetry to various combinations of providers, giving you much more choice and flexibility. And from a local development point of view - it&amp;rsquo;s also easy to spin up visualisation tools locally (eg. Jaeger), even if you&amp;rsquo;re using something different in production. Definitely something I&amp;rsquo;ll be embracing for all my projects moving forward!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Clifford is an airline pilot who&amp;rsquo;s also a freelance .NET developer who regularly blogs and speaks at conferences around the world!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a new .NET framework for building multi-platform apps - both mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (macOS/Windows) using C# and XAML in a single codebase. It also supports Blazor components for those that prefer that over XAML.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Episode 30: Developer Productivity with (me!) Dan Clarke</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0030-developerproductivity/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Developer productivity is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in for quite a few years. So I decided, rather than having a guest on for this topic - it&amp;rsquo;s one I wanted to cover myself. So in this first episode of the year - I&amp;rsquo;ve gone &lt;em&gt;solo&lt;/em&gt;, and talk about the things I find have made a big difference to my productivity over the years. Also why I think this term &amp;ldquo;10x developer&amp;rdquo; is a big understatement!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/SimonCropp&#34;&gt;Simon Cropp&lt;/a&gt; to chat about a form of testing called Snapshot testing! Simon is the author of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/VerifyTests/Verify&#34;&gt;Verify&lt;/a&gt;, which is a library that I&amp;rsquo;m quickly discovering is going to save me a HUGE amount of time when writing tests in dotnet! We chatted about snapshot testing in general; the various helper extensions that Verify has, which adds support for lots of different technologies; and also about testing in general. If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt that you spend too much time writing asserts in tests - then this is the episode for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

But if you can&amp;rsquo;t wait that long - the preview releases of both can be downloaded right now!

Bicep is a new DSL that transpiles down to native ARM templates. Except that it &lt;em&gt;greatly&lt;/em&gt; improved upon the very hard to read and write ARM templates, making &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure as Code&lt;/em&gt; in Azure a far nicer user experience. We delved into the Bicep language, the tooling, a bit of the history - and even geeked out a bit on how awesome .NET has become!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/markrendle&#34;&gt;Mark Rendle&lt;/a&gt; to chat about his experiences live-coding/streaming on Twitch! Warning: We went on a lot of tangents during the conversation! It&amp;rsquo;s all good though - as they were all awesome tangents! We not only talked about streaming, but also Blazor, C#, Unity, the rate of tech advancement, teaching kids to code, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-8904412&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/8904412-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8904412&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;marks-bio&#34;&gt;Mark&amp;rsquo;s Bio&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mark Rendle decided he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10, became a professional programmer when he was 16, and is still a programmer 30 years later. He worries that somebody is going to notice he’s having too much fun and make him stop. Right now he’s working on Visual ReCode, a tool for migrating .NET 4 WCF and Web API applications to ASP.NET Core 3.1. His hobbies include collecting jars of dark matter, high-altitude scuba diving, and making up stupid hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Blazor is a new .NET technology allowing you to build SPA-like frontend web UIs in C#! Very focused on developer productivity and componentisation - Blazor is certainly going to become my go-to for frontends moving forward! And chatting with Chris in this episode, has shown me even more reasons why Blazor is becoming so immensely popular!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We chatted about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://kontent.ai&#34;&gt;Kentico Kontent&lt;/a&gt; headless CMS, static websites and the JAMStack - plus much more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-8040535&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/8040535-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8040535&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;matts-links&#34;&gt;Matt&amp;rsquo;s links&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mattnield.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Matt&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mnield&#34;&gt;Matt on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kentico&#34;&gt;Kentico&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kentico.com/&#34;&gt;Kentico main website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kontent.ai/&#34;&gt;Kentico Kontent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xperience.io/&#34;&gt;Kentico Xperience&lt;/a&gt; (previously Kentico EMS):&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://bit.ly/kontent-uep&#34;&gt;Kentico Kontent extended 3-month trial offer from Matt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;other-links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Other links from the show&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://jamstack.org/&#34;&gt;JAMStack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/justeat/httpclient-interception&#34;&gt;HttpClient Interceptor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linqpad.net/&#34;&gt;LINQPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/j1DpsuoxfZ4&#34;&gt;Matt&amp;rsquo;s YouTube video on using Kentico Kontent with LINQPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://statiq.dev/&#34;&gt;Statiq .NET Static Site Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dotnetoxford/PrizeDraw&#34;&gt;.NET Oxford prize draw app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/justeat/httpclient-interception&#34;&gt;JustEat&amp;rsquo;s HttpClientInterceptor library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/events/276484104/&#34;&gt;.NET Oxford lightning talk event&lt;/a&gt; (mentioned in show due to Adam Storr&amp;rsquo;s talk on the JustEat HttpClientInterceptor library, and also Matt&amp;rsquo;s talk on web sustainability)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.notion.so/&#34;&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gotobrno.cz/en/&#34;&gt;Brno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0pilberk_Castle&#34;&gt;Špilberk Castle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robsimps_the-low-impact-website-organic-basics-activity-6711661849609416704-REBz&#34;&gt;Rob Simpson&amp;rsquo;s LinkedIn post about web sustainability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.luminary.com/blog/luminary-goes-carbon-neutral&#34;&gt;Luminary article with infographic about technology impacting the environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by Joe Albahari, author of one of my favourite software development tools - LINQPad! This is a tool that I use on a daily basis, and it saves me so much time! So I especially enjoyed chatting with Joe about the &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; features of LINQPad, his experiences when developing it, and also future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-7719526&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/7719526-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-7719526&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linqpad.net/&#34;&gt;LINQPad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.albahari.com/&#34;&gt;Joe&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/linqpad&#34;&gt;Joe/LINQPad on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;LINQPad Tips and Tricks blog post series: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/linqpad-tips-and-tricks&#34;&gt;Part1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/linqpad-tips-and-tricks-part2&#34;&gt;Part2&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/linqpad-tips-and-tricks-part3&#34;&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8DY5DndmxI&amp;amp;t=9s&#34;&gt;Writing a Neural Net from Scratch talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLX1sYVf-Xg&#34;&gt;Pushing C# to the limit talk&lt;/a&gt; (alarm clock reference)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-multi-platform-app-ui/&#34;&gt;.NET MAUI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For this very first episode of 2021, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/madSimonJ&#34;&gt;Simon Painter&lt;/a&gt; to talk all about Functional Programming in C#! We spoke about functional concepts, plus terms such as &lt;em&gt;Options&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Maybes&lt;/em&gt;, and even tried to explain what a Monad is! As usual, there were a few tangents, and we also touched on topics such as React, TDD, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-7108510&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/7108510-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-7108510&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Simon&amp;rsquo;s social links:&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/madSimonJ&#34;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thecodepainter.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-c-sharp&#34;&gt;Book: Functional Programming in C# by Enrico Buonanno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7WLC5As6g4&#34;&gt;Recording of Simon&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Functional Programming in C# talk&lt;/a&gt; (thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetsheff/&#34;&gt;.NET Sheff&lt;/a&gt; for this, as we didn&amp;rsquo;t record his talk at .NET Oxford)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/97344498&#34;&gt;Scott Wlaschin - Railway Oriented Programming video&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ramdajs.com/&#34;&gt;Ramda JS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/2020-more-succinct-csharp&#34;&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;Writing More Succinct C#&amp;rsquo; blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://reactjs.org/&#34;&gt;React&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning-ai/ml-dotnet&#34;&gt;ML.NET&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;DevTip links&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.ankiweb.net/&#34;&gt;Anki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://regex101.com/&#34;&gt;regex101.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://darklang.com/&#34;&gt;Darklang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this last episode of the year, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.twitter.com/christosmatskas&#34;&gt;Christos Matskas&lt;/a&gt; to talk all about Identity! Christos is the Program Manager for the Microsoft Identity Platform, so obviously the conversation was slightly biased towards AzureAD and B2C as an identity provider - but we also tried to cover some common identity topics, and demystify terminology such as OAuth, OpenID Connect, scopes, claims, and more! We even went a bit &lt;em&gt;off-piste&lt;/em&gt; at the end and chatted about public speaking, languages (not programming languages), and even touched on speed reading!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We ended up recording over two different sessions and covered lots of different topics, including functional programming and remote working.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-6103414&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/6103414-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-6103414&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/codeopinion&#34;&gt;Derek on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://codeopinion.com/&#34;&gt;Derek&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3RKA4vunFAfrfxiJhPEplw&#34;&gt;Derek&amp;rsquo;s YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR&#34;&gt;MediatR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/louthy/language-ext&#34;&gt;language-ext functional C# library&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/2020-more-succinct-csharp&#34;&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Writing More Succinct C#&amp;rdquo; blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwIEYPLXh3A&#34;&gt;Simon Painter&amp;rsquo;s Functional Programming in C# talk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linqpad.net/&#34;&gt;LINQPad&lt;/a&gt; (from devtips)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/linqpad-tips-and-tricks&#34;&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s LINQPad Tips and Tricks blog post series&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this very first episode, I introduce the podcast and what it&amp;rsquo;s all about! This is a short 6-minute episode talking about the focus of the podcast, who I am, and also a bit about &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/&#34;&gt;.NET Oxford&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-5829550&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/5829550-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-5829550&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;links-from-the-show&#34;&gt;Links from the show&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.danclarke.com/&#34;&gt;Dan&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/dracan&#34;&gt;Dan on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/dotnetoxford/&#34;&gt;.NET Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dotnetoxford.com/slack&#34;&gt;.NET Oxford Slack&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.meetup.com/Azure-Oxford/&#34;&gt;Azure Oxford&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <title>Alternative manual recording method</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/pages/guest-faq-manual-recordings/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you prefer not to use Discord and the Craig bot for the recording, then we can manually record audio locally. For example, perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s sensitive content that&amp;rsquo;s NDA at the time of recording, which you&amp;rsquo;d prefer not to be stored on the Craig bot&amp;rsquo;s servers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have no strong preference either way to whether we use Discord or manual recordings - as long as everyone in the call is comfortable recording their own audio and transferring the recorded wav to me somehow - Dropbox or OneDrive, etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Guest FAQ</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ever wondered what&amp;rsquo;s involved when being a guest on a podcast? Below are a few key points that I tend to mention to each guest. I thought I&amp;rsquo;d consolidate them here for quick reference&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-podcast-is-not-live&#34;&gt;The podcast is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; live!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of editing afterwards, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to chop bits out whilst editing. If you need to pause and think about how you&amp;rsquo;re going to answer a question - that&amp;rsquo;s fine - I chop that pause out. If you need to stop and Google something because you can&amp;rsquo;t remember the name - that&amp;rsquo;s fine too, I chop that out. If you need to cough, sneeze, have a drink, or go to the loo - that&amp;rsquo;s also fine. Also, if you say something that you then want to rephrase, or say more clearly - just say so, pause, and try again. I can cut out the first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
