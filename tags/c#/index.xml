      <description>throw new UnhandledExceptionPodcast(&amp;quot;Episode 72: Exceptions - With Callum Linington&amp;quot;);
In this episode, I was joined for a second time by Callum Linington - this time to discuss exceptions, which is quite fitting given the show&amp;rsquo;s name! We chatted about why you should avoid using exceptions for your main business logic and control flow, and explored better ways to handle errors. And I&amp;rsquo;m afraid the &amp;ldquo;monad&amp;rdquo; word got thrown in too! ðŸ™ˆ</description>
