      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was the first episode we&amp;rsquo;ve done which has been recorded live with an audience! It was hosted at the DDD South West conference in Bristol (UK), and I was joined by a panel of speakers. After introductions, I kicked off the conversation with a question about AI - and then we went from there, taking further dev-related questions from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-15052916&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/15052916-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-15052916&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;guest-bios&#34;&gt;Guest bios&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/carl-sargunar-63b5814/&#34;&gt;Carl Sargunar&lt;/a&gt; is an independent web and mobile application developer and technical consultant.
