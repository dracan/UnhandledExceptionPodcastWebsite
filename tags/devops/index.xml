      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Mattias Karlsson to chat about Cake! Nope, not the food - something even better! Cake is a build orchestration tool where your builds scripts are written in C#. There are tons of addons for most tasks you can think of, and it&amp;rsquo;s easy to write your own. And you can run these all locally just like you would on the build agent. I dread to think how many many days I&amp;rsquo;ve lost when doing CI/CD natively in YAML where I&amp;rsquo;ve had to push to CI/CD, waiting for a build agent to pick it up, just to find that I&amp;rsquo;d got a path or indentation wrong.</description>
