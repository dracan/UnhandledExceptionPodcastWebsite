      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by Nick Cosentino (DevLeader on the socials) to chat about refactoring code. We also discussed various other things, like automated testing, and how AI might affect us as developers, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nick Cosentino is a Principal Software Engineering Manager at Microsoft and a .NET content creator. He manages the teams responsible for deploying the hundreds of services supporting the Microsoft365 suite of products to serve users across the planet. Nick brings his unique experiences to the Big Tech world having worked at a startup that scaled from a handful of employees to hundreds before it went public. Nick runs a software engineering and dotnet-focused blog as well as a YouTube channel called Dev Leader. While he enjoys solving complex problems with software solutions, Nick is passionate about reducing barriers for people to get started on their software engineering journey.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
