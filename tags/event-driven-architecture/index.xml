      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Ian Cooper to chat about the Brighter and Darker frameworks.
Brighter is a framework for building messaging applications with .NET and C#. It can be used with an in-memory bus, or for interoperability in a microservices architecture allowing out of process messaging via a wider range of middleware transports. And Darker is the query counterpart to Brighter.
Ian is a Senior Principal Engineer at Just Eat Takeaway, frequent public speaker, and organiser of London .</description>
