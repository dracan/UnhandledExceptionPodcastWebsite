      <description>In this episode, I was joined for the second time by Nick Chapsas! This time, we chatted about his new Dometrain teaching platform. Nick started off creating courses on his own website, nickchapsas.com, which he&amp;rsquo;s recently rebranded to Dometrain and reached out to other authors to also create courses - myself included! I&amp;rsquo;ve recently released a Docker course on Dometrain, and we chatted about my experience doing this, as well as Nick&amp;rsquo;s story and motivations behind building Dometrain.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Isaac Levin that chat about&amp;hellip; way too many things to put in an episode title, that&amp;rsquo;s for sure! ðŸ˜‚ We decided to not have a particular topic in mind - and just chat and see where the conversation took us! We ended up talking about podcasting, working remotely and the pandemic, general career stuff, public speaking, containers, AWS, learning, mindsets, guitars, and more!</description>

      <title>Episode 30: Developer Productivity with (me!) Dan Clarke</title>
      <link>https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/posts/0030-developerproductivity/</link>

      <description>Developer productivity is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in for quite a few years. So I decided, rather than having a guest on for this topic - it&amp;rsquo;s one I wanted to cover myself. So in this first episode of the year - I&amp;rsquo;ve gone solo, and talk about the things I find have made a big difference to my productivity over the years. Also why I think this term &amp;ldquo;10x developer&amp;rdquo; is a big understatement!</description>
