      <description>Developer productivity is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in for quite a few years. So I decided, rather than having a guest on for this topic - it&amp;rsquo;s one I wanted to cover myself. So in this first episode of the year - I&amp;rsquo;ve gone solo, and talk about the things I find have made a big difference to my productivity over the years. Also why I think this term &amp;ldquo;10x developer&amp;rdquo; is a big understatement!</description>
