      <description>In this group episode, I was joined by Carl Sargunar, Lotte Pitcher, Carole Rennie Logan, and Callum Whyte, to discuss the Umbraco community and CMS! We chatted about the amazing community around Umbraco, as well as the features of the CMS itself. It definitely made me want to reach for Umbraco next time I need a CMS!

      <description>This was the first episode we&amp;rsquo;ve done which has been recorded live with an audience! It was hosted at the DDD South West conference in Bristol (UK), and I was joined by a panel of speakers. After introductions, I kicked off the conversation with a question about AI - and then we went from there, taking further dev-related questions from the audience.

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by both Tim Cadenbach and Matthias Jost to chat about the exciting new .NET community - We Are .NET! At its core, it&amp;rsquo;s a community portal aggregating and presenting videos, blogs, twitch, and other feeds of any creator with .NET content. However, it&amp;rsquo;s not just content aggregation though - and is becoming a rapidly growing community.
