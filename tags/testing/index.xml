      <description>In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by Nick Chapsas! If you&amp;rsquo;re a .NET developer - then his YouTube channel is an absolute must! Given all the amazing topics he covers on his channel - it would have been a shame to just chat with him about a single topic! So we decided to do a few lightning topics instead! Here&amp;rsquo;s what we geeked out on&amp;hellip;

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Simon Cropp to chat about a form of testing called Snapshot testing! Simon is the author of Verify, which is a library that I&amp;rsquo;m quickly discovering is going to save me a HUGE amount of time when writing tests in dotnet! We chatted about snapshot testing in general; the various helper extensions that Verify has, which adds support for lots of different technologies; and also about testing in general.</description>

      <description>Not long to go until the release of both .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022! But if you can&amp;rsquo;t wait that long - the preview releases of both can be downloaded right now! In this episode, I was joined by Kendra Havens to chat about what&amp;rsquo;s new and coming! Kendra is a Program Manager on the .NET and Visual Studio team, and we also chatted a bit in this episode about what software development is like internally at Microsoft, and learn that Microsoft face the same struggles as most other companies!</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by Chris Sainty to chat all about Blazor! Blazor is a new .NET technology allowing you to build SPA-like frontend web UIs in C#! Very focused on developer productivity and componentisation - Blazor is certainly going to become my go-to for frontends moving forward! And chatting with Chris in this episode, has shown me even more reasons why Blazor is becoming so immensely popular!</description>
