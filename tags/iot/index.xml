      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Clifford Agius to chat about both .NET MAUI, and also developing for IoT. (These were separate topics - not specifically IoT on MAUI). Clifford is an airline pilot who&amp;rsquo;s also a freelance .NET developer who regularly blogs and speaks at conferences around the world!
MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) is a new .NET framework for building multi-platform apps - both mobile (iOS/Android) and desktop (macOS/Windows) using C# and XAML in a single codebase.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Pete Gallagher - Microsoft MVP, Pluralsight author, speaker, user-group organiser, and huge fan of IoT devices and STEM. We had great fun chatted for over an hour about various topics - mostly themed around technologies helping kids get into coding - but with many tangents thrown into the mix!
