      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Tomek Masternak and Szymon Pobiega from Particular Software (NServiceBus) for a technical discussion about the Outbox Pattern! The pattern is designed to improve reliability of messaging by storing outgoing messages in a database table (the &amp;ldquo;outbox&amp;rdquo;) as part of the same transaction that modifies business data - allowing a separate process to read and publish those messages to a message broker.

      <description>In this episode, I had great fun chatting with Laïla Bougriâ about NServiceBus and how it can help with your distributed architecture. From its support for observability (including OTel) and dashboarding, to sagas and pub/sub. Even zombie and ghost messages! (spooky!). And as has been known to happen on this show - we did end up going on a tangent and geeking out about the awesome Jetbrains Rider too!
Laïla is a Solutions Architect and Software Engineer at Particular Software.</description>

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Ian Cooper to chat about the Brighter and Darker frameworks.
Brighter is a framework for building messaging applications with .NET and C#. It can be used with an in-memory bus, or for interoperability in a microservices architecture allowing out of process messaging via a wider range of middleware transports. And Darker is the query counterpart to Brighter.

      <description>In this episode, I was joined by Callum Linington to chat about Event Sourcing! Events over time are how the world works - so shouldn&amp;rsquo;t we be leveraging that in our architectures? As quite often happens, we also went on one or two tangents, and covered a ton of other related including MediatR, CQRS, F#, DDD, Rx, Redux, and more!
