      <description>As developers, we&amp;rsquo;re always looking for ways to improve and optimise our code. Yet we often neglect our body&amp;rsquo;s hardware and software. In this episode, I was joined by Rob West, to chat about how we can use mindfulness, nutrition, and exercise to upgrade our brain&amp;rsquo;s operating system. A large part of our discussion was about our ability to focus, why are brains naturally struggle with this, especially in the modern world - and techniques to help us with this.</description>

      <description>Developer productivity is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been really interested in for quite a few years. So I decided, rather than having a guest on for this topic - it&amp;rsquo;s one I wanted to cover myself. So in this first episode of the year - I&amp;rsquo;ve gone solo, and talk about the things I find have made a big difference to my productivity over the years. Also why I think this term &amp;ldquo;10x developer&amp;rdquo; is a big understatement!</description>
