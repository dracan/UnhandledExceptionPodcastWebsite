      <description>In this episode, I was thrilled to be joined by Nick Chapsas! If you&amp;rsquo;re a .NET developer - then his YouTube channel is an absolute must! Given all the amazing topics he covers on his channel - it would have been a shame to just chat with him about a single topic! So we decided to do a few lightning topics instead!

      <description>Not long to go until the release of both .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022! But if you can&amp;rsquo;t wait that long - the preview releases of both can be downloaded right now! In this episode, I was joined by Kendra Havens to chat about what&amp;rsquo;s new and coming! Kendra is a Program Manager on the .NET and Visual Studio team, and we also chatted a bit in this episode about what software development is like internally at Microsoft, and learn that Microsoft face the same struggles as most other companies!</description>
