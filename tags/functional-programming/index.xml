      <description>For this very first episode of 2021, I was joined by Simon Painter to talk all about Functional Programming in C#! We spoke about functional concepts, plus terms such as Options, Maybes, and even tried to explain what a Monad is! As usual, there were a few tangents, and we also touched on topics such as React, TDD, and much more!

      <description>In this second episode, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to welcome Derek Comartin (also known as CodeOpinion) onto the show to talk about CQRS and MediatR! We ended up recording over two different sessions and covered lots of different topics, including functional programming and remote working.
