      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was honoured to be joined by Steve &amp;ldquo;ardalis&amp;rdquo; Smith to chat about Modular Monoliths! We discussed the benefits of going down the Modular Monolith route instead of moving to microservices. We also chatted about how MediatR can help with this, and also about creating online courses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steve is an entrepreneur and software developer with a passion for building quality software as effectively as possible. He provides mentoring and training workshops for teams with the desire to improve. Steve has been recognized as a Microsoft MVP for over 10 consecutive years, and is a frequent speaker at software developer conferences and events. He is the top contributor to the official documentation on ASP.NET Core and enjoys helpings others write maintainable, testable applications using Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s developer tools.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
