      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://debbie.codes/&#34;&gt;Debbie O&amp;rsquo;Brien&lt;/a&gt; to chat about &lt;a href=&#34;https://playwright.dev/&#34;&gt;Playwright&lt;/a&gt; - Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s open-source end-to-end testing framework. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Playwright, so I was really excited to have this chat with Debbie. We covered a lot of ground, including features such as Codegen, Trace Viewer, and UI Mode. We also spoke a lot about AI - including the exciting &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp&#34;&gt;Playwright MCP Server&lt;/a&gt; which enables AI agents to automate browser interactions!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
