      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this episode, I was joined by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/markrendle&#34;&gt;Mark Rendle&lt;/a&gt; to chat about his experiences live-coding/streaming on Twitch! Warning: We went on a lot of tangents during the conversation! It&amp;rsquo;s all good though - as they were all awesome tangents! We not only talked about streaming, but also Blazor, C#, Unity, the rate of tech advancement, teaching kids to code, and much more!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div id=&#34;buzzsprout-player-8904412&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://www.buzzsprout.com/978640/8904412-hello-world.js?container_id=buzzsprout-player-8904412&amp;player=small&#34; type=&#34;text/javascript&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;marks-bio&#34;&gt;Mark&amp;rsquo;s Bio&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mark Rendle decided he wanted to be a programmer when he was 10, became a professional programmer when he was 16, and is still a programmer 30 years later. He worries that somebody is going to notice he’s having too much fun and make him stop. Right now he’s working on Visual ReCode, a tool for migrating .NET 4 WCF and Web API applications to ASP.NET Core 3.1. His hobbies include collecting jars of dark matter, high-altitude scuba diving, and making up stupid hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
