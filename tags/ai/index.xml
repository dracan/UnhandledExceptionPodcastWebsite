      <description>This was the first episode we&amp;rsquo;ve done which has been recorded live with an audience! It was hosted at the DDD South West conference in Bristol (UK), and I was joined by a panel of speakers. After introductions, I kicked off the conversation with a question about AI - and then we went from there, taking further dev-related questions from the audience.
