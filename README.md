# Prerequisites

* Hugo (extended version is installed) - `choco install hugo-extended` on Windows (see Hugo docs for other OSs)
* As well as cloning this repository, also run `git submodule update --init` so that submodules are also pulled down

# Running locally

* Run `go.ps1` (which just runs `hugo server -D`)
